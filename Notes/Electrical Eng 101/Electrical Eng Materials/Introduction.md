###### Conductors
These are the materials that having plenty of free electrons in their valence orbit which are responsible for electrical and heat conduction. The valence and conduction band energies overlap in them. the mechanism of electron conduction through conduction occurs in accordance with free electron theory are explained later. Gold(Au), silver(Ag), copper(Cu), aluminium(Al) are good electrical conductors. Oxygen-free high conductivity (OFHC) copper conductor is very suitable for low-temperature applications.

Electrical resistivity of conductors is of the order of $10^{-9}$ ohm-meter, and is influenced by temperature, impurities, alloying elements, and plastic deformation. Effects of these factors are determined by Nordheim equation and Matthilssen rule.

###### Semiconductors
These are the solids having energy gap $E_g$ lying in between the conductors and insulator. Their conductivity is more than that of the dielectrics but less than that of conductors. They are basically electronic materials viz, silicon(Si) and germanium(Ge) in element form. The element form remains in pure state and is called **INTRINSIC** semiconductor. Intrinsic semiconductors are of no practical utility since they desire an extremely high voltage $10^8$ volts for conduction across the energy gap. Hence, they are doped to make **EXTRINSIC** semiconductors.

Semiconductors are generally hard and brittle, and posses negative coefficient of temperature resistance. In contrast with conductors whose conductivity increases with purification, the conductivity of semiconductors decreases with purification.

###### Dielectrics
These are the insulating materials in which the valence electrons are tightly bound to their parent atoms. Therefor, they require a very large electric field to remove these electrons from the atoms. Dielectrics are characterized by 
- a full valence band
- an empty conduction band, and
- a large energy gap ($E_s > 3 eV$ ).
