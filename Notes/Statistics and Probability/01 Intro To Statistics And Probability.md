## What is Statistics ?
Statistics is a branch of mathematics and a field of study that involves collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting numerical data. It deals with the study of data and the methods used to extract meaningful information and insights from that data.

---
## Probability
Probability is a mathematical tool used to study randomness. It deals with the chance (likelihood) of an an event occurring.

### Common Vocabulary
1. **Target Population**: This is a particular group of interest
2. **Sampled Population**: This is a group from which the sample is taken.
3. **Sampling Frame**: This is a physical list of all members of the sampled population.
4. **Sample**: This is a subset of the population from which data are collected.
5. **Census**: This is a study in which data are obtained from every member of the population.
6. **Variable**: This is a value or characteristic that changes among members of the population.
7. **Data**: These are the counts, measurement , or observations gathered about a specific variable in a population in order to study it.
8. **Parameter**: This is a numerical description of a population characteristic.
9. **Sample Statistic**: This is a numerical description of sample characteristics.

### The objectives of Statistics
1. **Describing Data**: Statistics involves summarizing and describing data using various measures such as mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation. These measures help in understanding the central tendency, variability, and distribution of data.
2. **Drawing conclusions**: Statistical methods are used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on a sample. It involves using probability theory to make predictions and generalizations about a larger group (population) based on a subset of that group (sample).
3. **Making Decisions and Predictions**: Statistics helps in decision-making by providing tools and techniques for analyzing data and making informed choices or predictions.

### The Branches of Statistics
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: It involves the methods used to summarize and describe the features of a dataset. Descriptive statistics include measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation), as well as graphical representations like histograms, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots and the likes.
2. **Inferential Statistics**: This branch involves using sample data to draw conclusions or make inferences about a larger population. Inferential statistics includes hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, and other techniques that help in making predictions or generalizations about populations based on sample data.

### Data, Sampling, and Variation in Data and Sampling.
#### Data
Data may come from a population or from a sample. Lowercase letters like $x$ or $y$ generally are used to represent data values. Most data can be put into the following categories:
- Qualitative
- Quantitative

**Qualitative data** are the result of categorizing or describing attributes of a population. Qualitative data are also often called **categorical data**. Hair color, blood type, ethnic group, the car a person drives, and the street a person lives are examples of qualitative data. Qualitative data are generally described by words or letters. For instance, hair color, might be black, dark, light brown, blonde, gray, or red. Blood type might be AB+, O-, or B+. 

**Quantitative data** are always numbers. Quantitative data are the result of **counting or measuring** attributes of a population. Amount of money, pulse rate, weight, number of people in a town, are examples of quantitative data. Quantitative data may be either **discrete or continuous**.

All data that are the result of counting are **quantitative discrete data**. These data take on only certain numerical values.

Data that are not only made up of counting numbers, but that may include fractions, decimals or irrational numbers, are called **quantitative continuous data**. Continuous data are often the results of measurements like lengths, weights, or times.

#### Sampling
Gathering information about an entire population often costs too much or is virtually impossible. Instead, we use a sample of the population. **A sample should have the same characteristics as the population it is representing**. Most statisticians use various methods of random sampling in an attempt to achieve this goal. There are several different methods of **random sampling**. In each form of random sampling, each member in a population initially has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. Each method has pros and cons. The easiest method to describe is called a *simple random sample*.

>[!note] Simple Random Sample
> Any group of n individuals is equally likely to be chosen as any other group of n individuals if the simple random sample technique is used.

Other well-known random sampling methods are the stratified sample, the cluster sample, and the systematic sample.

To choose a *stratified sample*, divide the population into groups called strata and then take a *proportionate* number from each stratum. For example, you could stratify (group) your college population by department and then chose a proportionate simple random sample from each stratum (each department) to get a stratified random simple. To choose a simple random sample from each department, number each member of the first department, number each member of the second department, and do the same for the remaining departments. The use simple random sampling to choose proportionate numbers from the first department and do the same for each of the remaining departments. Those numbers picked from the first department, picked from the second department, and so on represent the members who make up the stratified sample.

To choose a *cluster sample*, divide the population into clusters(groups) and randomly select some of the clusters. All the members from these clusters are in the cluster sample. For example, if you randomly sample four departments from your college population, the four departments make up the cluster sample. Divide your college faculty by department.  The departments are the clusters. Number each department, and then choose four different numbers using simple random sampling. All members of the four departments with those numbers are the cluster sample.

To choose a *systematic sample*, randomly select a starting point and take every $n^{th}$ piece of data from a listing of the population. For example, suppose you have to do a phone survey. Your phone book contains 20,000 residence listings. You must choose 400 names for the sample. Number the population 1-20,000 and then use a simple random sample to pick a number that represents the first in the sample. Then choose every fiftieth name thereafter until you have a total of 400 names (you might have to go back to the beginning of your phone list). Systematic sampling is frequently chosen because it is a simple method.

A type of sampling that is non-random is convenience sampling. *Convenience sampling* involves using the results that are readily available. For example, a computer software store conducts a marketing study by interviewing potential customers who happen to be in the store browsing through the available software. The results of convenience sampling may be very good in some cases and highly biased (favor certain conditions) in others.

True random sampling is done *with replacement*. That is, once a member is picked, that member goes back into the population and thus may be chosen more than once. However for practical reasons, in most populations, simple random sampling is done *without replacement*. Surveys are typically done without replacement. Most samples are taken from large populations and the sample tends to be small in comparison to the population. Since this is the case, sampling without replacement is approximately the same as sampling with replacement because the chance of picking the same individual more than once with replacement is very low.

#### Variation in Data
**Variation** is present in any set of data. For example, 16-ounce cans of beverage may contain more or less than 16 ounces of liquid. In one study, eight 16 ounce cans were measured and produced the following amount (in ounces) of beverage:
$$\{15.8;16.1;15.2;14.8;15.8;15.9;16.0;15.5\}$$
Be aware that as you take data, your data may vary somewhat from the data someone else is taking for the same purpose. This is completely natural.

### Frequency, Frequency Tables, and Levels of Measurnment
Once you have a set of data, you will need to organize it so that you can analyze how frequently each datum occurs in the set. However, when calculation the frequency, you may need to round your answers so that they are as precise as possible.

#### Answers and Rounding Off
A simple way to round off answers is to carry your final answers one more decimal place than was present in the original data. Round off only the final answer. Don not round off any intermediate results, if possible. If it becomes necessary to round off intermediate results, carry them to at least twice as many decimal places as the final answer. For example, the average of the three quiz scores four, six, and nine is 6.3, round off to the nearest tenth, because the data are whole numbers. Most answers will be rounded off in this manner.

#### Levels of Measurement
The way a set of data is measured is called its *level of measurement*. Correct statistical procedures depend on a researcher being familiar with levels of measurement. Not every statistical operation can be used with every set of data. Data can be classified into four levels of measurement. They are (from lowest to highest level):
- Nominal scale level
- Ordinal scale level
- Interval scale level
- Ratio scale level

Data that is measured using a nominal scale is qualitative(categorical). Categories, colors, names, labels and favorite foods along with yes or no responses are example of nominal level data. Nominal scale data are not ordered. For example, trying to classify people according to their favorite food does not make any sense.

Data that is measured using an ordinal scale is similar to nominal scale data but there is a big difference. The ordinal scale data can be ordered. An example of ordinal scale data is a list of the top five national parks in the United States. The top five parks can be ranked from one to five, but we cannot measure differences between the data.

Data that is measured using the interval scale is similar to ordinal level data because it has a definite ordering but there is a difference between data. The differences between interval scale data can be measured though the data does not have a starting point.

Data that is measured using the ratio scale takes care of the ration problem and gives you the most information. Ratio scale data is like interval scale data, but it has a 0 point and ratios can be calculated. For example, four multiple choice statistics final exam scores are 0, 68, 20 and 92(out of possible 100 points). The exams are machine graded.

The data can be put in order from lowest to highest: 20, 68, 80 92

The difference between the data have meaning. The score 92 is more than the score 68 by 24 points. Ratios can be calculated. the smallest is 0. So 80 is four time 20. The score 80 is four times better than the score of 20.


#### Frequency
Twenty students were asked how many hours they worked per day. Their responses, in hours, are as follows: 5; 6; 3; 3; 2; 4; 7; 5; 2; 3; 5; 6; 5; 4; 4; 3; 5; 2; 5; 3

###### The Table below lists the different data values in ascending order and their frequencies.
| DATA VALUE | FREQUENCY |
| ---------- | --------- |
| 2          | 3         |
| 3          | 5         |
| 4          | 3         |
| 5          | 6         |
| 6          | 2         |
| 7          | 1          |

- A *frequency* is the number of times a value of the data occurs.
- A *relative frequency* is the ratio (fraction or proportion) of the number of times a value of data occurs in the set of all outcomes to the total number of outcomes. To find relative frequencies, divide each frequency by the total number of students in the sample - in this case, 20. Relative frequencies can be written as fractions, percents, or decimals

| DATA VALUE | FREQUENCY | RELATIVE FREQUENCY       |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| 2          | 3         | $\frac{2}{20}$ or $0.15$ |
| 3          | 5         | $\frac{5}{20}$ or $0.25$ |
| 4          | 3         | $\frac{3}{20}$ or $0.15$ |
| 5          | 6         | $\frac{6}{20}$ or $0.30$ |
| 6          | 2         | $\frac{2}{20}$ or $0.10$ |
| 7          | 1         | $\frac{1}{20}$ or $0.05$                         |

The sum of the values in the relative frequency column is $\frac{20}{20}$, or $1$

- *Cumulative relative frequency* is the accumulation of the previous relative frequencies. To find the cumulative relative frequencies, add all the previous frequencies to the relative frequencies for the current row, as shown in the table below:
 
| DATA VALUE | FREQUENCY | RELATIVE FREQUENCY | CUMULATIVE RELATIVE FREQUENCY |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| 2          | 3         | 0.15               | 0.15                          |
| 3          | 5         | 0.25               | 0.15 + 0.25 = 0.40            |
| 4          | 3         | 0.15               | 0.40 + 0.15 = 0.55            |
| 5          | 6         | 0.30               | 0.55 + 0.30 = 0.85            |
| 6          | 2         | 0.10               | 0.85 + 0.10 = 0.95            |
| 7          | 1         | 0.05               | 0.95 + 0.05 = 1.00                              |

The last entry of the cumulative relative frequency column is one, indication that one hundred percent of the data has been accumulated.

>[!note] 
>Because of rounding, the relative frequency column may not always sum to one, and the last entry in the cumulative relative frequency column may not be one. How every, they each should be close to one.
