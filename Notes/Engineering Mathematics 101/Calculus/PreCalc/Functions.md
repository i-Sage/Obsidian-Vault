Functions serve as a relationship between two set of elements where each element in the domain corresponds to exactly one element in the range. They are often denoted as $f(x)$ or $y = f(x)$, where $x$ represents the input (independent variable) and $f(x)$ represents the output (dependent variable).

### Basics of Functions:
- Domain and Range: The domain is the set of all possible input values for a function, and the range is the set of all possible output values.
- Function Notation: $f(x)$ denotes a function of x. Functions can be named with any letter or symbol.
- Graphs of Functions: Representing functions visually on coordinate planes helps understand their behavior.

### Types of Functions:
- Linear Functions: These type have the form $f(x) = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
- Quadratic Functions: Have the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \text{ where } a, b,  \text{ and } c \text{ are constants}$
- Exponential Functions: Written as $f(x) = a \cdot b^x$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants and $b$ is the base.
- Trigonometric Functions: Sine, cosine, tangent, e.t.c involving angles in triangles or circles.
- Logarithmic Functions: Inverse functions of exponential functions, written as $f(x) = \log_b(x)$, where $b$ is the base.

### Properties and Concepts:
- Even and Odd functions: Even functions have symmetry around the y-axis, while odd functions have rotational symmetry.
- Inverse Functions: Functions that reverse the action of another function $f^{-1}(x)$ undoes what $f(x)$ does.

### Operations on Functions:
1. Sum/Difference of Functions: If you have two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, their sum is denoted as $f(x) + g(x)$, and their difference is $f(x) - g(x)$.
	- Example: if $f(x) = 2x + 3$ and $g(x) = x^2 - 1$, then $f(x) + g(x) = 2x + 3 + x^2 - 1$.

2. Products and Quotients of Functions: Multiplying two functions means applying one function to the output of the other. For functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, their products is written as $f(x) \cdot g(x)$ or simply $f(x)g(x)$. Taking Quotients of two functions means applying the reciprocal of the divisor function to the dividend function. This is represented as $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$.
	- Example: if $f(x) = x + 1$ and $g(x) = 3x - 2$, then $f(x) \cdot g(x) = (x+1)(3x - 2)$
	- Example: if $f(x) = x^2 - 4$ and $g(x) = x - 2$, then $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2}$.

3. Composite Functions: Created by combining two or more functions written as $f \circ g(x)$ or $f(g(x))$. It involves applying one function to the output of another. This operation in not commutative, meaning $f(g(x))$ is not always equal to $g(f(x))$.
	- Example: if $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = 3^x + 1$, then $f(g(x)) = (3x = 1)^2$.

4. Inverse Functions: If $f$ and $g$ are inverse functions, applying one function to the output of the other results in the identify function. This is denoted as $f(g(x)) = g(f(x)) = x$.
	- Example: if $f(x) = 2x + 3$ and $g(x) = \frac{x-3}{2}$, then $f(g(x)) = g(f(x)) = x$.

5. Scaling/Stretching and Shrinking:
	- Vertical Scaling: Multiplying a function by a constant $a$ alters its vertical scale. For instance, $af(x)$ stretches or compresses the graph vertically.
	- Horizontal Scaling: Multiplying a function by a constant $a$ affects the horizontal scale. The graph expands or contracts horizontally for $f(ax)$.

6. Shifting/Translation:
	- Vertical Shift: Adding or subtracting a constant $k$ to a function $f(x)$ shifts the graph vertically by $k$ units. This is denoted as $f(x) + k$ or $f(x) -k$.
	- Horizontal Shift: Adding or subtracting a constant $h$ inside the function $f(x)$ shifts the graph horizontally by $h$ units. This is represented as $f(x-h)$ or $f(x+h)$. 

7. Reflection:
	- Reflection Over x-axis: Changing $f(x)$ to $-f(x)$ reflects the graph over the x-axis. 
	- Reflection Over y-axis: Transforming $f(x)$ to $-f(x)$ reflects the graph over the y-axis
