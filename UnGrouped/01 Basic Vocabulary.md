## What is Statistics ?
>Statistics is a branch of mathematics and a field of study that involves collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting numerical data. It deals with the study of data and the methods used to extract meaningful information and insights from that data.


### Common Vocabulary
1. **Target Population**: This is a particular group of interest
2. **Sampled Population**: This is a group from which the sample is taken.
3. **Sampling Frame**: This is a physical list of all members of the sampled population.
4. **Sample**: This is a subset of the population from which data are collected.
5. **Census**: This is a study in which data are obtained from every member of the population.
6. **Variable**: This is a value or characteristic that changes among members of the population.
7. **Data**: These are the counts, measurement , or observations gathered about a specific variable in a population in order to study it.
8. **Parameter**: This is a numerical description of a population characteristic.
9. **Sample Statistic**: This is a numerical description of sample characteristics.


### The objectives of Statistics
1. **Describing Data**: Statistics involves summarizing and describing data using various measures such as mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation. These measures help in understanding the central tendency, variability, and distribution of data.
2. **Drawing conclusions**: Statistical methods are used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on a sample. It involves using probability theory to make predictions and generalizations about a larger group (population) based on a subset of that group (sample).
3. **Making Decisions and Predictions**: Statistics helps in decision-making by providing tools and techniques for analyzing data and making informed choices or predictions.

### The Branches of Statistics
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: It involves the methods used to summarize and describe the features of a dataset. Descriptive statistics include measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation), as well as graphical representations like histograms, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots and the likes.
2. **Inferential Statistics**: This branch involves using sample data to draw conclusions or make inferences about a larger population. Inferential statistics includes hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, and other techniques that help in making predictions or generalizations about populations based on sample data.
